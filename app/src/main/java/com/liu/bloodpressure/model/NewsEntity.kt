        "What is blood pressure?",
        "Blood pressure is the force of blood pushing against the walls of arteries. With each heartbeat, blood is pumped into the arteries. Blood pressure is highest when the heart beats and pumps blood, known as systolic pressure. When your heart is at rest between beats, your blood pressure decreases. This is called diastolic pressure.\nYour blood pressure reading is represented by these two numbers. Typically, the systolic value is higher than or comes before the diastolic value. For example, 120/80 means a systolic pressure of 120 and a diastolic pressure of 80.",

        "How is high blood pressure diagnosed?",
        "High blood pressure usually has no symptoms. Therefore the only way to determine whether you have this condition is by getting regular blood pressure checks from your healthcare provider. Your provider will use a gauge a stethoscope or electronic sensor and a blood pressure cuff. Before making a diagnosis he or she will take two or more readings at separate appointments.",

        "Types of Hypertension",
        "There are two main types of high blood pressure: primary (essential) hypertension and secondary hypertension.\n\nPrimary or essential hypertension is the most common type of high blood pressure. For most people with this type of blood pressure it gradually increases as they age.\n\nSecondary hypertension is caused by another medical condition or the use of certain medications. It usually improves after treating the underlying condition or discontinuing the medications that are causing it.",

        "Healthy Diet: To help control blood pressure you should limit your intake of sodium (salt) and increase your dietary potassium. Eating low-fat foods and including plenty of fruits vegetables and whole grains is also important. The DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) eating plan is an example of a diet plan that can help lower blood pressure.\n\nRegular Exercise: Physical activity can help you maintain a healthy weight and lower blood pressure. Aim for at least 2 and a half hours of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise per week or 1 hour and 15 minutes of high-intensity aerobic exercise. Aerobic exercises such as brisk walking involve any activity that raises your heart rate and requires more oxygen than usual.",

        "What Is Gestational Hypertension?",
        "Pregnancy-induced hypertension refers to elevated blood pressure that occurs during pregnancy. It typically begins after 20 weeks of pregnancy. You usually don't experience any other symptoms. In many cases it won't harm you or your baby and will resolve within 12 weeks after delivery. However it does increase your risk of future hypertension. Sometimes it can be severe and may lead to low birth weight or preterm birth. Some women with pregnancy-induced hypertension may indeed develop preeclampsia.\n\nChronic hypertension refers to high blood pressure that is present before or before the 20th week of pregnancy. Some women may have had this condition long before pregnancy but it's only discovered during prenatal blood pressure checks. Sometimes chronic hypertension can also lead to preeclampsia.",

        "Delivery typically can cure preeclampsia. When making treatment decisions your provider considers several factors including the severity of the condition how far along you are in your pregnancy and the potential risks to you and your baby:\n\n1. If you are beyond 37 weeks of pregnancy your provider may consider inducing labor or performing a cesarean section.\n\n2. If you are less than 37 weeks pregnant your healthcare provider will closely monitor both you and your baby. This may involve blood and urine tests for you. Monitoring for the baby often includes ultrasounds fetal heart rate monitoring and assessing the baby's growth. You may need medications to control your blood pressure and prevent seizures. Some women might receive steroid injections to help the baby's lungs mature more quickly.",

Emphasize vegetables fruits and whole grains.\n2. Include low-fat or fat-free dairy products fish poultry legumes nuts and vegetable oils.\n3. Limit foods high in saturated fat. These foods include fatty meats full-fat dairy products and tropical oils like coconut oil palm kernel oil and palm oil.\n4.
